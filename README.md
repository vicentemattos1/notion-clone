# Notion clone using React + Vite + Tiptap

This application is font-end only, it is possible to edit the text and create a custom text with all the functionalities like Bold, italic, code block and others.

The user can interact with the application by typing anything, double clicking any text or typing "/" to open the Bubble menu or the floating menu.

Possible upgrades: Add integration with RadixUI for more accessibility on menus, add more text edition options
